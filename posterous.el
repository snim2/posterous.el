;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs integration for posterous.com.
;; It currently supports posting text (only) to posterous.

;; Place the .el file somewhere on you load path (e.g. ~/.emacs.d/) and
;; set the following variables in your .emacs or init.el file:

;; posterous-email    -- your email address or username on posterous.com
;; posterous-password -- your password on posterous.com

;; and you can interact with posterous.com using the functions:

;; M-x posterous-getsites
;; -- places a list of sites that you own on posterous.com.
;; -- Includes siteids.
;; -- Currently still formatted as XML.

;; M-x posterous-region
;; -- post a region of text to posterous

;; M-x posterous-region-private
;; -- post a region of text to posterous as a private post.

;; M-x posterous-buffer
;; -- post a buffer of text to posterous.

;; M-x posterous-buffer-private
;; -- post a buffer of text to posterous as a private post.

;; If you do not wish to post to your default posterous site, you can
;; customise the variable:

;; posterous-default-siteid

;; to discover the siteids of all your sites, use M-x posterous-getsites.

;; If you do not wish to autopost to your social networks connected to
;; your posterous.com account, place the following in your Emacs
;; configuration file:

;; (setq posterous-suppress-autopost)
